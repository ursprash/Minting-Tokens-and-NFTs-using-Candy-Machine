# Minting-Tokens-and-NFTs-using-Candy-Machine
Creating a full UI for a Candy Machine and setting up an SPL token involves multiple steps, and it's beyond the scope of a single response. However, I can provide you with an outline of the process and the necessary steps to get started.

## Project Overview

![Solana Logo](https://cryptologos.cc/logos/solana-sol-logo.png?v=024)

1.Create an SPL token.
2.You will need to tweak your config.json to use the splTokenAddress of the token you created in Step 1.
3.Create a UI for your candy machine 

## Getting Started

1. Set Up Your Environment:
   - Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer.

2. Create a React Application:
   - Initialize a new React application using Create React App or your preferred React setup.

3. Set Up a New Wallet
   - We first need to create a new wallet for specifically devnet testing

```bash
solana-keygen new --outfile ./wallet.json
```
We can skip the password (by hitting Enter) as we will only use this wallet on devnet, so the funds are not important. We can confirm that the wallet we just generated is the wallet that the Solana CLI will use by running: 
```bash
solana config set --keypair ./wallet.json
```
4.Establish a Connection to Your QuickNode RPC
We will need to make sure our Solana CLI is connected to a node. You're welcome to use public nodes or deploy and manage your own infrastructure, however, if you'd like 8x faster response times you can leave the heavy lifting to us.
With your endpoint on the Solana Devnet setup, you can now run this command, substituting YOUR_QUICKNODE_URL with the HTTP URL you have copied:
```bash
solana config set --url YOUR_QUICKNODE_URL
```
Now to fund your wallet you can run the command:
```bash
solana airdrop 5
```
### Prepare NFT Assets
1.Configure Candy Machine
Create a new file, config.json in your root project folder: 
```bash
echo > config.json
```
Open the file and paste this config: 
```bash
{
    "price": 0.01,
    "number": 10,
    "symbol": "NB",
    "sellerFeeBasisPoints": 500,
    "gatekeeper": null,
    "solTreasuryAccount": "YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS",
    "splTokenAccount": null,
    "splToken": null,
    "goLiveDate": "2022-07-24T00:00:00Z",
    "endSettings": null,
    "whitelistMintSettings": null,
    "hiddenSettings": null,
    "uploadMethod": "bundlr",
    "awsS3Bucket": null,
    "retainAuthority": true,
    "isMutable": true,
    "creators": [
    {
      "address": "YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS",
      "share": 100
    }
  ]
}
```
2.Sugar has a built in validation error that will let us check for any errors before we proceed. In terminal, run: 
```bash
sugar validate
```


**4. Configure Your Project:**
   - Modify your `config.json` to include the SPL token address you created earlier.
   - You can also configure other parameters related to your Candy Machine.

**5. Create UI Components:**
   - Design and implement your UI components for minting NFTs from the Candy Machine.
   - You can use libraries like React Bootstrap, Material-UI, or custom CSS for styling.

**6. Implement Candy Machine Integration:**
   - Use the Solana and Metaplex libraries to integrate with your Candy Machine.
   - You'll need to call functions like `startMint`, `mintOneToken`, etc., depending on your Candy Machine's configuration.

**7. Create ReadMe File:**
   - Write a README.md file to explain how to set up, run, and use your application.
   - Include instructions for installing dependencies, configuring the environment, and using the UI.

Here's a basic structure for your README.md file:

```markdown
 Candy Machine UI

This is a user interface for minting NFTs from a Candy Machine on the Solana blockchain.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the project folder: `cd candy-machine-ui`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Configuration

Edit the `config.json` file to configure your Candy Machine and SPL token settings.

## Usage

1. Start the development server: `npm start`
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to use the UI.
